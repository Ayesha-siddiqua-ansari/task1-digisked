Welcome to my **Portfolio Website** repository, a project showcasing my skills, achievements, and professional journey as a Computer Systems Engineering student and aspiring Front-End Developer. This portfolio features a responsive design with smooth navigation, highlighting sections such as *Home*, an introductory landing page; *About Me*, detailing my background, skills, and achievements; *Portfolio*, an interactive gallery of my projects with descriptions and links; and *Contact*, offering a form for communication and links to my social profiles. Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, and enhanced with **Font Awesome** icons, this website is both visually appealing and functional. Projects include responsive web designs, MATLAB text-to-speech applications, Arduino-based systems, Java GUI calculators, and more. To explore the portfolio, you can clone the repository and view it locally or visit it online via GitHub Pages. Contributions are welcomeâ€”fork the repository, propose improvements, or add features through pull requests.
